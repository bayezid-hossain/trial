 initial thoughts:
  1: i got to have some state to store the phone and validate it
  2: the validation can easily be done by server action and zod
  3: initial formatting can be done by basic handle input change (eg + at start, supports only number)
  4: some global padding
  5: button properties change based on server action response (eg success will have check mark and text changed)
